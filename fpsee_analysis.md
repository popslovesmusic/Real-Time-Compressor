# F.P.S.E.E. Multi-Dimensional Analysis

This document outlines the evaluation of the Hybrid Audio Compressor project against the F.P.S.E.E. (Factual, Pragmatic, Social, Emotional, Ethical) framework defined in the project proposal.

---

## F - Factual / Predictive Value
*This dimension quantifies the objective, measurable performance and accuracy of the system.*

### Lookahead Function
- **Metric:** Peak detection accuracy. We will measure how accurately the lookahead function allows the compressor to apply gain reduction at the precise start of a transient.
- **Metric:** Artifact reduction. We will objectively measure the reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD) on sharp transients compared to the non-lookahead version.

---

## P - Pragmatic / Efficiency Value
*This dimension measures the resource consumption and computational efficiency of the system.*

### Lookahead Function
- **Metric:** CPU Overhead. Using our profiler, we will measure the percentage increase in CPU usage introduced by the lookahead buffer and logic.
- **Metric:** Memory Usage. We will measure the additional RAM required to store the lookahead buffer.

---

## S - Social / Normative Value
*This dimension assesses the system's alignment with user expectations and professional standards.*

---

## E - Emotional / Relational Value
*This dimension evaluates the subjective, aesthetic, and qualitative aspects of the output.*

---

## E - Ethical / Moral Value
*This dimension measures the system against fairness metrics and its potential impact on stakeholders.*
